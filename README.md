# Data-Visualization

# This is my assignment for Data visualizaion. I downloaded the data of Hong kong geographical terrain and pick a region of mountaion area called Tai mo Shan.
# The intend is to 3D-visualized the Tai Mo Shan, so I use copilot to generate code for it. I also try to add wind partical system but fail to achieve a good visual result so I give the this part.
# I try my best to get a better look of the 3D terrain including adding plants and surface noise. The result is still far away from my expection. And I assume that it is the limitation of matplot and rasterio.
# In the future I think I should learn more about better ways or extentions to 3D-visualization.
